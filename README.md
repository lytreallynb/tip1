Need to know:

**Hash Table**
- Hash Function
- Translate and Compression
- Load Factor a = \frac{N}{M}
- Time Complexity
- Hash Collision Resolutions:
  1. Separate Chaining
  2. Open Addressing
    - Linear Probing
    - Quadratic Probing
    - Double Hashing
 
**Tree**
- Types of trees
  1. Complete Bianry Trees 2. Proper(Full) Bianry Trees
- Tree Traversals
  1. Pre-order 2. Post-order 3. In-order 4. Level (BFS)
- How can you reconstruct trees using exactly two traversal orders.
- Time Complexity

**AVL Tree**
- Calculate Height and Balance Factor
- Time Complexity
- Insertion and Deletion
- What is inorder successor (smallest right child) and predecessor (greatest left child)
- Four Rotation Cases: RL, RR, Double Rotation (opposite balance factor sign) * 2

**Graph Traversal**
- BFS and DFS
- MST
- Prim's Algorithm
- Kruskal's Algorithm
- TSP


**Algorithm Families**
- Brute-Force
- Greedy
- Divide and Conquer
- Branch and Bound
- Backtracking
- Dynamic Programming

**DP Problem**
- Solution
  1. Top Down (Recursive) 2. Bottom Up (Iterative)
- Fibonacci Numbers
- Binomial Coefficients
- Unique Path
- Climbing Stairs
- 0-1 Knapsack Problem

**Tips On DP Problem #25 To score the point, do five things!**
1. Look for return value of the function. 4’
2. Declare the memo! 4’
3. The Relationship members like for binomial coefficient obj1 + obj2 4’
4. Member combination with min or … 4’
5. Cover the search space recursive calls or loops, don’t go out of bounds 4’


**Exam Strategy (Help me with my exam!!!) To Score the maximum amount**
1. Read the whole exam paper first. Subconscious mind works!
2. Have three or four plans in case the MCQ / FRQ gets hard or looks easy. As detailed as possible.
3. Choose to do the exams following the order I want.
4. Read and know the exams well, give myself some confidence. Be COOL.
5. Time expectation maybe. Skip it don’t waste time on stuck problem. 
6. Create a overview with cheatsheet.
7. Don’t want my brain to make decision during the exam!!!
